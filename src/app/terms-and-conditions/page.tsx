                <p>
                  These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern the travel services
                  provided or arranged by Sairr, the brand under which Meenadeep
                  Experiences Private Limited (“Sairr”, “we”, “us” or “our”)
                  operates. They apply whenever you enquire about, book, pay for,
                  or participate in a Sairr Journey, whether through our website,
                  app, WhatsApp, phone, email or any other channel through which
                  Sairr offers or provides its services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These Terms apply to all Sairr Journeys, including group,
                  private and gifted Journeys. By booking or using a Sairr
                  service, you confirm that you have read and accepted these
                  Terms. If you are booking on behalf of another traveller, you
                  confirm that you are authorised to do so and that the relevant
                  traveller has been informed of these Terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These Terms are read together with your Booking Confirmation
                  and any Journey-specific terms Sairr provides for your booking.
                  Where Journey-specific terms expressly apply to a particular
                  booking, they will govern that booking to the extent of any
                  inconsistency with these Terms.

                <p>
                  Sairr’s role is to plan, coordinate and support your Journey
                  end-to-end. This includes understanding your requirements,
                  designing or curating your itinerary, arranging its components,
                  and providing on-Journey support through a Sairr Host, where
                  included in your booking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your Journey may include flights, accommodation, ground
                  transportation, activities, guides, meals and other services
                  delivered by independent Suppliers. Sairr arranges and
                  coordinates these services on your behalf, and works with each
                  Supplier so that what’s set out in your Booking Confirmation is
                  delivered as agreed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You don’t need to coordinate with individual Suppliers
                  yourself. Sairr remains your single point of contact for the
                  Journey and will step in on your behalf if something doesn’t go
                  to plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Suppliers are independent businesses. Sairr does not own,
                  operate or employ them or their staff, unless expressly stated
                  in your Booking Confirmation. Their independence does not
                  change Sairr’s role in coordinating your Journey or supporting
                  you when something arranged by Sairr doesn’t go as planned.
                  Section 16 (Liability) sets out the applicable liability
                  framework.

              <Section number={3} title="Bookings & Confirmation">
                <p>
                  You can express interest or reserve a spot without payment. A
                  departure becomes confirmed once Sairr confirms that it will
                  run for your requested date. Your booking is confirmed once you
                  have agreed to the applicable price and payment terms, made the
                  required payment, and received written Booking Confirmation
                  from Sairr. Until a Booking Confirmation is issued, Sairr does
                  not guarantee the availability of any Journey, date, price,
                  accommodation, transport, or other service.

                  Your Booking Confirmation is the authoritative record of your
                  booking. It sets out the applicable inclusions and exclusions,
                  itinerary, accommodation, transport, meals and experiences,
                  dates and duration, total price, payment schedule, and
                  cancellation and refund terms for your specific Journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If information on Sairr’s website, social media, marketing
                  material or earlier communications differs from your Booking
                  Confirmation, the Booking Confirmation will govern. Any changes
                  after confirmation will be subject to Section 7 (Changes to
                  Your Journey).
                </p>
                <p>
                  You should review your Booking Confirmation promptly and notify
                  Sairr of any error or discrepancy.
                </p>
              </Section>

              <Section number={4} title="Prices & Payments">
                <SubHead title="Prices" />
                <p>
                  Prices shown on Sairr’s website are indicative. The final price
                  may vary based on dates, seasonality, occupancy and flight fare
                  movements between the time of your enquiry and confirmation.
                  Except for flight-fare-driven movement, changes you request, or
                  government-imposed taxes and levies, the final price will not
                  vary by more than 10% from the indicative price shown to you at
                  the time of your enquiry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once your booking is confirmed, the price stated in your
                  Booking Confirmation is final, except for changes permitted
                  under these Terms, including changes requested by you under
                  Section 7 (Changes to Your Journey) or government-imposed
                  taxes, levies or charges that become applicable after
                  confirmation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Prices are quoted in INR unless your Booking Confirmation
                  states otherwise. The confirmed price includes the stated
                  inclusions and excludes the stated exclusions.
                </p>
                <SubHead title="Payment" />
                <p>
                  You can express interest in a Journey and reserve a spot at no
                  cost. Once the departure meets the applicable minimum group
                  size and is confirmed to run, as described in Section 4, a 50%
                  advance is due to secure your flights, accommodation, transport
                  and other arrangements. The remaining 50% is due 21 days before
                  departure. If you book within 21 days of departure, full
                  payment is required upfront.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a departure cannot be confirmed because the minimum group
                  size is not met, you will not be charged. You may choose
                  another available departure for the same Journey, subject to
                  availability and the applicable price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Your Booking Confirmation will state the applicable payment
                  schedule and due dates. If a payment is not received by its due
                  date, the booking will be treated as cancelled and the
                  applicable cancellation charges under Section 6 (Cancellations
                  & Refunds) will apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sairr currently accepts UPI, NEFT and RTGS, and may introduce
                  other payment methods, including third-party payment gateways.
                  Where a gateway is used, the provider’s own terms will also
                  apply to the payment transaction.

                <p>
                  If you wish to cancel a confirmed booking, the following
                  cancellation charges apply based on how many days remain before
                  departure, unless your Booking Confirmation expressly specifies
                  a different cancellation schedule for your Journey:

                <p>
                  In no case will the cancellation charge exceed the amount you
                  have actually paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The applicable cancellation tier is determined by the date
                  Sairr receives your written cancellation request. “Departure”
                  means the scheduled departure date stated in your Booking
                  Confirmation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Any refund due will be processed to your original payment
                  source within 7–10 working days of your cancellation being
                  confirmed.
                </p>

                  This Section does not apply to cancellations arising from a
                  Force Majeure Event, which are governed by Section 15 (Force
                  Majeure & Unavoidable Events).
                </p>
                <p>
                  If a Traveller does not show up for departure without prior
                  cancellation, this will be treated as a cancellation received
                  on the date of departure, and the applicable cancellation
                  charge under this Section will apply.

                  If Sairr cancels a confirmed Journey for reasons within Sairr’s
                  control, you can choose a full refund of all amounts paid, or
                  reschedule to another available date at no extra cost.

                  A requested change may affect the price, itinerary, inclusions

                  While we aim to deliver your Journey as confirmed,

                  Sairr may make minor adjustments to the itinerary for safety or

                  being treated as a material change under this Section. No

                  providers, activity operators, guides and restaurants. We

                  travellers we serve. Sairr sets clear service expectations with
                  each Supplier for the travellers we bring them, and stays

                  Each Supplier operates its own business and may have its own
                  terms, conditions, policies and requirements that apply to the
                  specific service it provides.

                  your Journey, for example an airline’s baggage policy or a
                  hotel’s check-in policy, those terms will apply in addition to

                <SubHead title="Indemnity">
                  You agree to indemnify Sairr against losses, costs and expenses
                  Sairr reasonably incurs as a direct result of your unlawful
                  conduct, fraud, deliberate misconduct, or material breach of
                  these Terms. This indemnity does not apply to losses arising
                  from Sairr’s own negligence or breach of these Terms.
                </SubHead>
                <SubHead title="Fraud & Misrepresentation">
                  You must provide Sairr with accurate and complete information
                  for your booking. If Sairr reasonably believes that a booking
                  involves fraudulent information, unauthorised use of payment
                  details, or a material misrepresentation of fact, Sairr may
                  cancel the affected booking, subject to applicable law. Where a
                  booking is cancelled under this provision, Sairr will return
                  amounts paid, less any costs Sairr has reasonably and
                  unavoidably incurred in connection with that booking.
                </SubHead>
                <SubHead title="Changes to These Terms">
                  Sairr may update these Terms from time to time to reflect
                  changes in its services, operating practices or applicable law.
                  The updated Terms will be published at sairr.in with a revised
                  effective date. Changes apply prospectively to bookings made
                  after the update; a Journey already confirmed remains governed
                  by the Terms in effect on the date its Booking Confirmation was
                  issued, unless a change is required by law or necessary for
                  safety.
                </SubHead>
                <SubHead title="Assignment">
                  Sairr may assign or transfer its rights and obligations under
                  these Terms to a successor entity in connection with a merger,
                  acquisition, restructuring or sale of substantially all of its
                  business, provided that this does not materially reduce your
                  rights under these Terms. Sairr will notify you of any such
                  assignment that affects your Journey. You may not assign your
                  rights or obligations under these Terms without Sairr’s prior
                  written consent.
                </SubHead>
                <SubHead title="Severability">
                  If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or
                  unenforceable, that provision will apply to the minimum extent
                  necessary to remove the invalidity, and the remaining
                  provisions will continue in full force and effect.
                </SubHead>
                <SubHead title="Waiver">
                  Sairr’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms on a
                  particular occasion does not waive its right to enforce that
                  provision, or any other provision, on a later occasion.
                </SubHead>
                <SubHead title="Entire Agreement">
                  For a specific Journey, these Terms and your Booking
                  Confirmation together constitute the agreement between you and
                  Sairr in relation to that Journey. Any applicable Supplier
                  terms referenced under Section 8 apply separately to the
                  specific Supplier service to which they relate. These Terms and
                  the Booking Confirmation supersede prior discussions or
                  representations on the same subject.
                </SubHead>
                <SubHead title="Relationship Between Parties">
                  Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, or
                  employment relationship between you and Sairr, or between Sairr
                  and any Supplier. Each Supplier operates as an independent
                  business and is not Sairr’s agent or employee.

                <SubHead title="Notices & Communication">
                  Sairr may communicate with you regarding your booking and
                  Journey through WhatsApp, email, telephone, or other contact
                  details you have provided to Sairr, and such communication will
                  be treated as valid notice for the purposes of these Terms. You
                  are responsible for ensuring that the contact details you
                  provide to Sairr remain accurate and accessible.

                  mandatory jurisdiction available to you under applicable law,
                  courts at Nagpur, Maharashtra shall have jurisdiction over
                  disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms. This
